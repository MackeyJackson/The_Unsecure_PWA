> **This progressive web app has been designed with a range of security vulnerabilities. The PWA was then adjusted to follow security standards as a part of my studies of the [NESA HSC Software Engineering Course](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/tas/software-engineering-11-12-2022/content/n12/fa039e749d). The app is NOT secure and should only be used in a sandbox environment.**

# The Unsecure PWA

Your client, "The Unsecure PWA Company", has engaged you as a software engineering security specialist to provide expert advice on the security and privacy of their application. This progressive web app is currently in the testing and debugging phase of the software development lifecycle.

## The task

You are to run a range of security tests and scans along with a white/grey/black box analysis of the application/source code to identify as many security and privacy vulnerabilities as possible. You are then required to prepare a professionally written report for your client that includes:

1. An overview of your approach to the technical analysis.
2. Document out-of-the-scope privacy and security issues of your report, including;
   - Security or privacy issues that cannot be mitigated by technical engineering solutions
   - Security issues that must be tested in the production environment
3. Identify all security or privacy vulnerabilities you discovered and provide an impact assessment of each.
4. Provide recommendations for "The Unsecure PWA Company's" security and privacy by design approach going forward.
5. Design and develop implementations using HTML/CSS/JS/SQL/JSON/Python code and/or web content changes as required to patch each vulnerability you discover.
